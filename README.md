----- INSTALLATION -----

- Clone the repo on your session.

- Go in the repo you've just cloned.

- execute the cview_inst.sh file.

- If you don't have a .bash_aliases. It will notify it and create it.

- check cview alias in ~/.bash_aliases with command : cat ~/.bash_aliases | grep cview (if it shows nothing, there is a problem).

- Start a new terminal and you should have the command .
  
If you've followed the instruction and still can't use the command. Don't execute the cview_inst.sh twice, contact me I will be happy to help, my username is wfotso on the 42 intra.

----- USE -----

- Go to the repo of your project (exemple : c00/).

For ALL exercices :
- Write the command : cview ./ to have a the description of ALL your exercices.

For ONE exercice (here example : ex01/) :
- Write the command : cview ex01/ to have a the description of ex01.

----- INFORMATIONS -----

- You need a main to compile but you can leave in comment and still run the command.
- Your C file need the 42 header or the command won't work.
- It will not work on compilation that need multiple .c file like the Rush00. ( I will add this feature if i have the time).
- Running the command will not create or delete files in your directory. If it does, please contact me my username is wfotso on the 42 intra.
 
I created this command to help everyone test their own code or to evaluate someone (if he has dowloand the command). So don't hesitate to recommand the command to them.

GOOD LUCK !!!
